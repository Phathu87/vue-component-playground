# Part 5 - Bonus Concepts

## Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
Use frameworks like **Nuxt.js** to enable SSR in Vue. It boosts SEO, speed, content visibility and initial load time but introduces complexity in deployment and state management.
- `npx nuxi init app`, then run `npm install && npm run dev`

## Progressive Web App (PWA)
Convert Vue apps into PWAs using **Vue CLI PWA plugin**. Key features:
- Service workers (for offline access)
- Web manifest (for installability)
- Caching strategies
- Must run on HTTPS

Use libraries like `workbox` or `vite-plugin-pwa` if using Vite.
